# Vancouver Parks Dashboard

## About

This project implements an interactive, public‑facing dashboard showcasing all registered parks in Vancouver. The dashboard allows users to explore each park in detail, including its location, available amenities, and key features, such as size. Through intuitive visualizations and map‑based navigation, users can easily examine the geographic distribution of parks across the city and dive deeper into the facilities that matter most to them. The goal is to make Vancouver’s park system more accessible, informative, and engaging for residents, visitors, and planners alike.

## Dataset Information
This dashboard visualizes the [City of Vancouver's Parks dataset](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/parks/table/), which contains information on 218 parks in Vancouver.

<h1 align="center">Project Proposal: The Vancouver Park Dashboard</h1>

People in Vancouver look for parks in everyday situations, not just for “green space.” Someone might be walking around downtown and want the nearest park to sit for a bit, or a family might want a park with washrooms, or a group might be planning a small birthday and wants a park that’s large enough compared to other options. Right now, that kind of search usually means jumping between maps and long lists, and it’s not always obvious which park meets a specific need. This project is meant to make that process easier for the general public by letting people search parks based on simple requirements and immediately see the best options.

For this dashboard, the goal is straightforward: help users find parks and compare them quickly. The dashboard will focus on practical questions a normal person would ask, such as “which park is closest,” “which parks have washrooms,” “which ones are accessible,” and “how big is this park compared to others.” Instead of making users interpret raw tables, the dashboard will turn the data into something visual and interactive so decisions can be made in a few clicks.

The dataset used is the City of Vancouver Parks dataset, and it includes park names, neighbourhood information, address details, park area in hectares, and several useful Y/N indicators such as washrooms, facilities, special features, and accessibility. Since the dashboard is built for public use, the dataset will be simplified slightly so only meaningful fields remain. Columns that don’t help a public user (like internal identifiers or fields that don’t vary) will be removed, and the street number and street name will be combined into a single readable address field. This keeps the data clean and makes the table and hover tooltips easier to understand.

The dashboard layout will be designed for quick searching and comparison. Filters will be placed on the left so users can narrow parks based on features like washrooms, accessibility, and other available indicators. On the right, the main view will be an interactive map of Vancouver showing only the filtered parks; hovering or clicking a park marker will reveal key details such as the park name, neighbourhood, address, and size. Below or beside the map, a sortable table will list the filtered parks, allowing users to sort by size or other relevant fields when choosing between multiple options. A small summary chart will also show a quick breakdown of the filtered results, such as parks with washrooms versus parks without washrooms, and a toggle will allow the chart to switch between washrooms and accessibility so users can view different needs at a glance.

Overall, this project is meant to be practical and user-focused: a simple tool that helps Vancouver residents and visitors find the right park based on what they actually care about, without making them dig through complicated data or multiple websites.
